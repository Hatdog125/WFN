                    *Hello, fellow Worlds players!*<br><br>

                    Since I came onboard Worlds FRVR exactly 3 years ago, it was very much still in its infancy. There were practically no players to speak of and many of the current features you enjoy today had not been developed yet. Since then, me, the developer team and all of you lovely players have been instrumental in making our community grow and blossom in to what it is today with contests, events, feature updates and all manners of community interactions.<br><br>

                    Today I am announcing that I will as of June no longer be the community manager of Worlds FRVR. I will however remain within the FRVR ecosystem as part of a brand new content and marketing team which will be producing media content for many games within the FRVR portfolio, Worlds included. This means that I will still be part of this game and see you all frequently, but not at the same capacity and extent as before. This means that I will not be hosting contests, events, streams and other tasks related to the growth of this fine community.<br><br>

                    I would like to thank the developer team for being awesome to work with this entire time, as well as Benjaminsen in particular for bringing me on-board three years ago. I would also like to thank all of you for making this the best job I've ever had and for helping me. There would be no community to speak of if not for all of you.<br><br>

                    It has been an enormous privilege to spend time with all of you fine players, new and veterans alike, and I am confident with the new features underway, Worlds FRVR will continue to grow in to something amazing.<br><br>

                    *Signing off,*<br>
                    *MicChiFRVR* ðŸ––

                        Attention, building enthusiasts! We have some exciting news for all the dedicated players of Worlds FRVR. While the official contests may have come to an end, the spirit of competition and creativity will continue to thrive within our vibrant community.<br><br>

                        I, Doc, am thrilled to announce that with the help of this great community we will continue challenging everyone who thinks they can make it to the top of the Worlds builder society and claim the (un)official crown as a Champion of Worlds!<br><br>

                        Join us in this new chapter of community-driven contests, where all players will have the opportunity to showcase their talent and be recognized for their incredible creations. Whether it's constructing awe-inspiring structures, designing intricate landscapes, or crafting immersive worlds, there will be a contest for every aspiring architect and visionary.<br><br>

                        Stay tuned for updates and announcements regarding the upcoming contests. Not a lot will change to the way the official contests were held, besides the prize pool. All the rules that applied then will be taken over to the community contests and we will continue updating you on new events and winners on Social Media (including here on Discord) the way you're used to.<br><br>

                        The first Community Contest will start <strong>next week on Monday!</strong>
