                    *Hello, fellow Worlds players!*<br><br>

                    Since I came onboard Worlds FRVR exactly 3 years ago, it was very much still in its infancy. There were practically no players to speak of and many of the current features you enjoy today had not been developed yet. Since then, me, the developer team and all of you lovely players have been instrumental in making our community grow and blossom in to what it is today with contests, events, feature updates and all manners of community interactions.<br><br>

                    Today I am announcing that I will as of June no longer be the community manager of Worlds FRVR. I will however remain within the FRVR ecosystem as part of a brand new content and marketing team which will be producing media content for many games within the FRVR portfolio, Worlds included. This means that I will still be part of this game and see you all frequently, but not at the same capacity and extent as before. This means that I will not be hosting contests, events, streams and other tasks related to the growth of this fine community.<br><br>

                    I would like to thank the developer team for being awesome to work with this entire time, as well as Benjaminsen in particular for bringing me on-board three years ago. I would also like to thank all of you for making this the best job I've ever had and for helping me. There would be no community to speak of if not for all of you.<br><br>

                    It has been an enormous privilege to spend time with all of you fine players, new and veterans alike, and I am confident with the new features underway, Worlds FRVR will continue to grow in to something amazing.<br><br>

                    *Signing off,*<br>
                    *MicChiFRVR* ðŸ––
